Data Set 1 - CDC VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) 2019.
Includes 3 data sets - Primary Information, Symptoms, Vaccines with around 16,000 rows each.
This data states whether or not an adverse event took place after a vaccine was administered and
	what took place afterwards. Our main focus is the fact that many patients died while also having
	adverse effects. We want to see if anything outside of the vaccine itself can be attributed to the death.
Among the 3 data sets variables include - patient age, the type of vaccine taken, state/time injection
	administered, gender, symptoms (though these are all unique), death of patient, ER visit,
	hospitilization, if symptoms life threatening, if recovered, if they had current illnesses,
	and vaccine information such as type, manufacturer, dose, and administration site.

Data Set 2 - Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System - 2014 (unless we find more recent year).
Includes 1 data set with 464,000 rows.
This data set is comprised of interviews from US residents about general health, mental health, and
	medical expenses. We want to pair this data with our first set to see if we can find more connections
	to the adverse event deaths.
Variables include state, health ratings, health coverage, doctor information, exercise, sleep, and
	various general questions related to physical and mental health.

We want to use these data sets primarily to find out if there is any connection to the adverse events that
	took place and a persons general health or other information. Is it just babies and old people that are having
	issues with vaccines? Is there something in common the old people have? Is it physical health, mental health,
	or some other underlying factor such as where they live or health care issues. With these data sets we hope
	to find some sort of correlation between the two.
