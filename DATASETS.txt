Data Set 1: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) 2019.

The dataset consists of 3 files - Primary Information, Symptoms and Vaccines with around 16,000 rows each. 
This data states whether or not an adverse event took place after a vaccine was administered and 
what took place afterwards. Our main focus is the fact that many patients died while also having
adverse effects. We want to see if anything outside of the vaccine itself can be attributed to the death.
Among the 3 data sets variables include - patient age, the type of vaccine taken, state/time injection
administered, gender, symptoms (though these are all unique), death of patient, ER visit,
hospitilization, if symptoms life threatening, if recovered, if they had current illnesses,
and vaccine information such as type, manufacturer, dose, and administration site.

describe the data in the dataset, making
note of the interesting attributes and relationships in the data. Include 3-5 rows of
sample data from each file. Very important: explain what insights you hope to gain from
analyzing the data. If you donâ€™t know why you want to analyze the data, you should stop
now and look for a different dataset for the project.
	
Data Set 2 - Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System - 2014 (unless we find more recent year).
Includes 1 data set with 464,000 rows.
This data set is comprised of interviews from US residents about general health, mental health, and
	medical expenses. We want to pair this data with our first set to see if we can find more connections
	to the adverse event deaths.
Variables include state, health ratings, health coverage, doctor information, exercise, sleep, and
	various general questions related to physical and mental health.

We want to use these data sets primarily to find out if there is any connection to the adverse events that
	took place and a persons general health or other information. Is it just babies and old people that are having
	issues with vaccines? Is there something in common the old people have? Is it physical health, mental health,
	or some other underlying factor such as where they live or health care issues. With these data sets we hope
	to find some sort of correlation between the two.
