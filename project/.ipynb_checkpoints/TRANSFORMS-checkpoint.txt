check for the presence of duplicate records in each modeled table. If duplicate
records exist, give an example of the duplicate records in question in a file
named TRANSFORMS.txt.

check for any referential integrity violations. If violations exist, give an example of
the violations in question in the file named TRANSFORMS.txt.

if the CAST function returns an error, make a note of the field and the error in the
file named TRANSFORMS.txt.

Duplicate records exist in both modeled tables. 
Example in Vaccine_Events includes VAERS_ID 791470 where patient had three separate and different vaccines administered on the same day. 
Example in Patient_Events includes VAERS_ID 794157 where patient had more than 5 symptoms listed therefore second entry created in original Symptoms table to include all reported symptoms.

Only Events table has a primary key of VAERS_ID since all other tables contain duplicates. Because of this, referential integrity is not violated. Each foreign key is linked to a primary key in Events. If record in Events is deleted, the other tables will not have a relationship with the main record. Therefore, tables can only be joined if primary key in Events exists so no violations are made.

Cast was not used in the models due to all features being assigned the correct type during staging.
